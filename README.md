# Web application generator

 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jozefizso/generator-gowebapp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jozefizso/generator-gowebapp)

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator that scaffolds out a front-end web app. Inspired by the [generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp) and [generator-assemble](https://github.com/assemble/generator-assemble).


## Getting Started

- Install: `npm install -g generator-gowebapp`
- Run: `yo gowebapp`
- Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

![](http://i.imgur.com/JHaAlBJ.png)

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```
$ npm install -g yo
```
